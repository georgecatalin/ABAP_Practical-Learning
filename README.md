# ABAP Practical Learning
Practical work for learning ABAP Language concepts

Topics to cover:
* string operations: CONCATENATE, SPLIT, CONDENSE, SHIFT, FIND, substrings
* using string comparison operators CO,CN,CA,NA,CS,NS,CP,NP with special characters (*,+ and #).
* operations with internal tables and work areas: APPEND, LOOP, MODIFY, DELETE, READ TABLE, CLEAR, REFRESH, DESCRIBE TABLE, SORT
* understand the types of internal tables: standard, sorted and hashed
* understand the difference between internal tables with header lines (obsolete as of now) and internal tables without header lines.
* using selection screens (input screens) with parameters and screen-options
* using screen blocks and understanding the internal table behind the select-options
* using sy-uline and sy-vline system variables to draw boundaries of the tables in classic reports style
* use best performance guidelines with ABAP Programming (e.g. parallel cursors when dealing with nested loops)
* using events in classic reports of ABAP :
* * INITIALIZATION,
  * AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT, AT SELECTION SCREEN, START-OF-SELECTION, TOP-OF-PAGE, END-OF-PAGE, END-OF-SELECTION.
